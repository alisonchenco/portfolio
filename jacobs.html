        <h5>Design Concepts Applied in Web Development</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-9">
        <p>Primarily, the design process is identifying the problem, and come up
            with solutions to alleviate or solve the situation. In the book, The Design of Everyday Things,
            it talked about the double-diamond model. In which, I believe that the model only stands as
            a very general and ideal state of the design process. In the actual designing process, it is
            not as simple as the diverge-converge process. Ideas and realizations often emerge at random
            times and stimulate more thoughts.</p>

        <p>In specific, the stages of design would be observing, generating, prototyping and testing. In my working experience, I have learned the importance of prototyping and creating mock-ups. A client’s imagination of the design in mind may be considerably different as the developer’s. The mock-up would stand as the most cost and time effective way in presenting the thoughts. For instance, when designing a website, I would use tools like photoshop or sketch to create a basic view of the site. For example when I was redesigning the website for Center for Microbiome Innovation (as shown below). I wanted to create a navigation bar that looks like microbes (left figure). During that time, I believed my design was very creative and was confident that the client would like it. As I was about to start building the site, the client told me he prefers the traditional navigation bar design. I was disappointed yet glad that it was just a prototype. I end up creating another mock-up (right figure). The experience had taught me the importance of building prototypes in the designing process. My perspective may vary with the client. Without the prototype, I would have to rebuild the website.</p>

        <p>Wireframing provides an early visual that can be used to review with the user/client. It is helpful for usability tests and easier to amend than concept design.
          Wireframing is extremely important in UI designing process. It helps not only the user/client, but also the designer to have a better understanding of their own design concept. A wireframe could be a hand drawing sketch: a simple sketch that can deliver the structure of the product. A wireframe could also be clickable HTML web page.
          As a web developer assistant in Jacobs, I create simple sketches as wireframes before developing the complicated prototype on photoshop.</p>

        <p>I created these wireframes for a Professor’s research lab webpage. In order to give the client more options, I created two wireframes for her to decide on. After the client decided on what they like, I made the right wireframe into a detailed prototype. Wireframing allowed me to convey my mental model to the client efficiently and effectively.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-9">
            <p>Reflecting on the design concepts, I was once confused about the difference between prototype and wireframe. After understanding the two terms in depth, I realized that wireframe focuses on simplicity, which is often low to medium fidelity. It includes some boxes and lines sketched on paper, while the interactivity is created at a minimum, allowing the users to focus on the structure instead of the looks. A prototype would be the next step of wireframing, which focuses not only on structure but more on the looks that is often medium to high fidelity.</p>
