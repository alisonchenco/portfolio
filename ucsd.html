                  <p>The users helped us to identify the core problems of the UCSD App‚Äôs Dining Sections during their interviews and tasks. Their favored method of choice of letting us know these was by verbally complaining about the app itself. We went in further through tasks and a few more ‚Äúwhy‚Äôs‚Äù to pinpoint their exact grievances felt when navigating the the Dining Section.</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>No search bar: A lot of work, tedious to scroll endlessly to look for what someone wants</li>
                      <li>No filtering: Cannot filter the search</li>
                    </ul>
                  <i>"There was no way to see the distinctions between dining halls and PC restaurants at a quick glance, so I felt frustrated that there wasn't a simple search tool." (User 15)</i>
                  <p><small>Users most notably voiced their frustrations over the lack of a search bar, finding it tedious to scroll endlessly until they came across their desired restaurant or detail. With the lack of filtering, they often found themselves scrolling past the specific restaurants we had asked them to find during the tasks. We witnessed users like User 15, who scrolled through the Jamba Juice section a total of 5 separate times before finding it during Task 5, voice their frustration at an apparent lack of ordering.</small></p>
          
                  <h6><span class="highlighter">Disorganized</span></h6>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Unordered: No apparent order, information is scattered (e.g. not ordered alphabetically or by distance)</li>
                      <li>Not categorized: No visual difference between dining hall, market, restaurant, coffee place or something else</li>
                    </ul>
                  <i>‚ÄúSo disorganized. Doesn't make me want to use this app because it's hard to use. I hate that I have to keep scrolling, there's no search bar, nothing to filter what I'm looking for‚Äù (User 4).
                  ‚ÄúIt is pretty useless. There is no filtering, it needs search bar. . . disorganized!‚Äù (User 5).</i>
                  <p><small>We heard this word come up again and again: disorganized. With the Dining Section being ranked in no apparent order, information felt scattered to the users. There was no integration of order either alphabetically, categorically, or location-based distances. This created a loss of dependability within the user‚Äôs perceptions of the app; this was not a resourceful tool they would routinely use when expecting fast solutions to their needs. The lack of categorization was visually implicit; there was no apparent difference between a dining hall, market, restaurant, cafe or anything else.</small></p>
          
                  <h6><span class="highlighter">Lack of Differentiation</span></h6>
                    <ul>
                      <li>No comparison on the prices: Impossible to determine what‚Äôs cheap and expensive </li>
                      <li>Users unsure of what type of food is served at each establishment</li>
                    </ul>
                  <i>‚Äú. . .it's a long list and there is no order, should have separate dining halls and restaurants‚Äù (User 18)</i>
                  <p><small>There is no visible comparison between establishments on the Dining Section start menu. This was exemplified in Task 8, where users had difficulty determining the difference between cheap and expensive places to get meals on-campus. Users were also unsure of what type of food was served at each of these places. When prompted to tell us the most expensive  and the cheapest place on campus, User 15 went as far as to admit defeat from the app saying, ‚ÄúI have no idea how to do this. They don‚Äôt even have an expenses indicator, I give up.‚Äù This kind of learned helplessness was almost inevitable from a design point of view. User 16 voiced this exact problem by saying, ‚ÄúHow do I do that? I would have to go through every single one.. There‚Äôs no way to quickly tell..unless I go through every single menu item and look at prices.‚Äù</small></p>

                <p>Although the UC San Diego mobile app does afford users the ability to search through the application to answer all their questions, it is not the most realistic or efficient way of providing information preoccupied students or faculty. The app had become more of an inconvenience than a daily tool to be utilized.
                  These trends kept repeating themselves, in our data and in the visible frustrations of our users.</p>
                <p>Before completing the interviews ‚Äúin the real world,‚Äù we anticipated that our primary problems would center around a lack of information or restaurant details. However, the core problems as revealed by the users were more deeply rooted in the uncertainty they faced when overwhelmed with too many options. As discussed later in our eventual re-design, we forgoed making the most viable information available for practical and eye-catching ways of presenting information such as payment methods and hours.</p>
