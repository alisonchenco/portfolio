			<h3>01. Main Project ‚Äî RSS Proactive Feature</h3>
			<h4 style="color:#F07822;">UX Design + Interaction Design</h4>
			<p>For the Technology Solution team, my primary role was user experience and interaction design. With other interns (5 engineers and 1 PM), we designed and developed an application that helps hundreds of engineers to better troubleshoot medical devices in a cloud based platform.

			<div class="col-sm-9">
				<p>BD Remote Support Service (RSS) is the BD enterprise-class solution offering remote management and support of BD products deployed at healthcare organization. Using industry-standard secure technologies, the team of BD RSS technicians ensures customers receive quick and proactive support. It serves more than 140,000 BD products around the world with 24/7 support.</p>

				<h5>Process</h5>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-9">
		
				<p>During the design and development process, our team was introduced with the Agile Scrum development framework. Agile Scrum is a software development method that helps team work efficiently; it encourages teams learn through experiences, self organize while working on problems, and reflect on the outcomes to continuously improve. I found the Agile Scrum framework helpful, which helped me to track the process of the development team.</p>

					<h5>Research üîç</h5>
					</div>
					<div class="col-sm-9">
						<p>During the research stage, I learned who the users are, the needs, and the current softwares technical context. I learned in depth about the Pyxis Medication Device, and how BD resolves customer issues through their Technical Service Center. I learned about the different software platforms engineers use to resolve the issues, and how they solve the problems before the customers are inconvenienced. I also created user flow of the engineers. Later, I highlighted areas that are representing the engineer‚Äôs pain points which I tackled in my design solutions.

					<p>I took all the information to brainstorm and then developed several solutions. Later, I went around for a quick feedback on the ideas, combined several good ideas, and started drafting the solution.

					<h5>User Testing üí¨</h5>
					</div>
					<div class="col-sm-9">
					<p>Since our users (support engineers) are around the globe, I conducted the user testing via Skype meeting calls with screen sharing. During the user interviews, with 6 technical support engineers, I was able to talk to 6 technical support engineer and learn about their workflow, details of different platforms they are using. Talking directly to the users allowed me to understand the platforms that I never understood, and details that I would have overlooked. The user testing was powerful in the design process, allowed me to clarify the user pain points, design preferences, and validate my prototypes.

					<p>Following the user interviews, I made iterations on the prototype, and conducted second and third rounds of user testing with 5 technical support engineers. Making adjustments based on the iterations was essential.</p>

				<h5>Final Design</h5>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-9">
				<p>During the three months, I focused on designing the user experience of the web application. I researched on the troubleshooting process, designed user flows, created mid/high fidelity prototypes, conducted user testing, iterated, and assisted in HTML/CSS with front-end engineer on build the web application.</p>
		
				<p>By the end of the internship, our team was able to push the web application (It‚Äôs live!). The most rewarding part was the user‚Äôs reactions when I showed him/her our final product. ‚ÄúOh my god, I love this! When can I get to use it?‚Äù one user said. These moments remind me how meaningful ux design is, and how UX really impacts users.</p>
		
				<p>On the last day, we gave a final presentation to the president of medical management solutions, stakeholders, and leaders/managers from BD.

				<h3>03. Side Project ‚Äî Designing a Team T-Shirt</h3>
				<h4 style="color:#F07822;">Visual Design</h4> 
				<p>One thing I learned during my internship is to be willing to help and constantly ask for more. Throughout the internship, I told my manager that I could assist in additional work if needed. One day, my manager came and asked me if I was interested in designing a T-Shirt for his team. The RSS (Remote Support Service) team had a new release of the software and new t-shirt for the team was needed.</p>

					<h5>Draft</h5>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-9">
					<p>After exploring some designs, I decided on isometric design, since it is one of the latest design trends and it would work well with BD‚Äôs medical devices. Isometric design is the combination of flat design and 3D design, without converging perspective lines. I really like how the design is simple, yet gives you different perspectives on an object.
