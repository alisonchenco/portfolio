      <p>For the Technology Solution team, my primary role was user experience design and interaction design. Together with other interns (5 engineers and 1 PM), we designed and developed an application that helps hundreds of engineers to better troubleshoot medical devices in a cloud based platform.

        <p>During the design and development process, our team was introduced with Agile Scrum development framework. Agile Scrum is a software development method that helps team to work efficiently, it encourages teams to learn through experiences, self organize while working on a problem, and reflect on the wins and losses to continuously improve. I found the Agile Scrum framework helpful, which helped me to track the process of the development team.</p>

                <p>During the research stage, I learned who the users are, the needs, the context. I learned in depth about the Pyxis Medication Device, and how BD resolves customer issues through their Technical Service Center. I learned about the different software platforms the engineers uses to resolve the issues before the customer is inconvenience. I also created task flow and highlighted areas that are representing the pain points which I will tackle my design solutions on.

            <p>Since our users are around the globe, in different cities and countries, I conducted the user testing via Skype meeting call with screen sharing.

          <p>During the three months, I focused on designing the user experience of the web application. In which, I researched on the troubleshooting process, designed user flows, created mid/high fidelity prototypes, conducted user testing, and helped to build the web application.</p>

          <p>By the end of the internship, our team was able to push the web application (It‚Äôs live!). The most rewarding part was the user‚Äôs reactions when I showed them our final product. ‚ÄúOh my god, I love this! When can I get to use it?‚Äù one user said. This was one of the best moments that reminded me how meaningful ux design is, and how ux is really impacting users.</p>

          <p>On the last day, we gave a final presentation to the president of medical management solutions, stakeholders, and leaders/managers from BD.

        <p>One thing I learned during my internship, is to be willing to help and constantly ask for more. Throughout the internship, I asked my managers that I could assist in additional work if needed. One day, my manager came and asked me if I am interested in designing a T-Shirt for his team. The RSS (remote support service) team had a new release on the software and new t-shirt design for the team is needed.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-9">
        <p>After exploring some designs, I decided on isometric design, since it is the latest design trends and it would work well with BD‚Äôs medical devices. Isometric design is the combination of flat design and 3D design, and there are no converging perspective lines. I really like how isometric is simple, yet gives you more perspectives on an object.
